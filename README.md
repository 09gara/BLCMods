# BLCMods

This is a repository for Community Mods made for the Borderlands series, specifically BL2 and BLTPS.

These mods should use the `set` command in the Unreal console to change in-game variables.
If your mod has specific considerations you should make it clear how to install.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BL2CP/BLCMods/wiki). If you want to find specific mods by category, check [repository with sorted mods](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki)

## Requirements

These mods can only be installed on PC and will **never** be ported to consoles due to technical and legal limitations.    
All **non-headhunter** DLC is required for the patch and likely most mods.

support will most likely **NOT** be given for errors that the UCP cause due to missing DLC.

Individual mod support for errors is up to the author of the mod and is a case by case basis.

**DO NOT EXPECT TO BE *ENTITLED* TO HELP**, each member of BLCM and the discord is an individual first then a modder second, is doing this for free, and have (potentially busy) lives to live.

That being said most members of BLCM are more than willing to help if you remember this.

## Contribution

If you are not part of BLCM and wish to contribute a mod:
- create a **personal** `Fork` of the BLCM/BLCMods repository (top right).

- **On your personal fork**, `Commit`(upload) files to the respective folders. (either `Borderlands 2 mods` *or* `Pre Sequel Mods`)  under a personal folder that shares your github username.
  
  E.g. (`Borderlands 2 mods/your name/mod.txt`or`Borderlands 2 mods/your name/mod name/mod.txt`)
  
  Most people will appreciate your directory more if you use the second formating.

- **While still on your personal fork**, send a `Pull Request` to `Compare` merge your fork to the `master` branch.

- Make sure that the `branch` of **your** `fork` that you wish to submit (#1) on the **right side** is correct, and `BLCM/BLCMods` `master` branch is on the **left**, then submit the request (#2).

- Then wait for someone on [BLCM](https://github.com/BLCM) to accept, merge and commit your request for you, if it takes more than a week feel free to ping someone on the discord to let them know that you've been waiting an extended period of time for a pull request.

-This is ***NOT*** permission to ping someone as soon as you send a pull request, remember that not everyone is on discord/Github 24/7, it will take some time regardless if you ping someone or not, and will be seemingly random at times, so please be patient when waiting for approval.

If you are part of [BLCM](https://github.com/BLCM) you do not need to fork or pull request.

## ModPacks

If you wish to contribute a modpack (or a compilation of mods):
- you **must** provide a screenshot or other proof of agreement from ***EACH*** mod author if you wish for your modpack to be accepted.
- preferably using an image gallery of screenshots using an image hosting website of your choice, such as https://imgur.com/
- modpacks are submitted the same way as regular contributions, so scroll up to read instructions on how to do so.
