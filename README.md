# BLCMods

This is a repository for Community Mods made for the Borderlands series, specifically BL2 and BLTPS.

These mods should use the `set` command in the Unreal console to change in-game variables.
If your mod has specific considerations you should make it clear how to install.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BL2CP/BLCMods/wiki). If you want to find specific mods by category, check [repository with sorted mods](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki)

## Requirements

These mods can only be installed on PC and will **never** be ported to consoles due to technical and legal limitations.    
All non-headhunter DLC is required for the patch and likely most mods.

## Contribution

If you are not part of BLCM, to contribute a mod:
- `Fork` the repository (top right).
- `Commit` files to the respective folders. (either `Borderlands 2 mods` or `Pre Sequel Mods`)    
  under a personal folder that shares your github username    
  E.g. (`Borderlands 2 mods/SomeDude/mod.txt`)
- Send a `Pull Request` to `Compare` merge your fork to the `master` branch.

If you are part of [BLCM](https://github.com/BLCM) you do not need to fork or pull request.

## ModPacks

If you wish to contribute a modpack (or a compilation of mods):
- you **must** provide a screenshot or other proof of agreement from **each** mod author if you wish for your modpack to be accepted.
- preferably using an image gallery of screenshots using an image hosting website of your choice, such as https://imgur.com/
- modpacks are submitted the same way as regular contributions, so scroll up to read instructions on how to do so.

## Installation
