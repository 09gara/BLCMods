# Mods

## Respawnable Excalibastard
- Makes it so you can grab an Excalibastard whenever you want regardless if you picked it up in the playthrough already, you still need the 2500 badass rank, however.

## Better Handling Moon Buggies
- Makes the Moon Buggies handle the same way as Bandit Technicals as BL2, making them less awful.
