TPS Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech
===================================

Work in progress!

Mod Overview
------------

* Adds all legendaries + uniques (weapons, grenade mods, class mods,
  shields, oz kits) into the global "legendary" loot pools, so
  you'll start seeing those much more frequently.
* Makes Moonstones drop 2x more often

Compatibility
-------------

This'll be interesting - The TPS UCP touches a lot of the same stuff
that we'll be touching here.  Will figure it out as I go...

Loot Purposefully Excluded from Pools
-------------------------------------

There's some gear which I felt shouldn't be in the pools at all.  I am
quite willing to hear counterarguments; my mind could probably be pretty
easily persuaded otherwise if someone feels strongly about it.

* Springs' Oz Kit
* Cracked Sash (Shield)
* Contraband Sky Rocket grenade *can* spawn, but has a much decreased
  chance compared to all the other legendaries.

TODO
----

* Check legendary drop pools
* Legendary COM pool seems to be almost entirely Celestial.  Occasionally
  Chronicler, and no Eridian Vanquishers.  Figure that out.
