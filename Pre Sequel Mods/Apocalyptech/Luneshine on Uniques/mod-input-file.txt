    # Several unique/legendary weapons in TPS don't have any Luneshine
    # attachments specified in the game data, so they will never spawn
    # with Luneshine.  This mod fixes those, and additionally sets it
    # up so that they will ALWAYS have Luneshine, so long as your game
    # is currently allowing luneshine on loot drops.  (UCP's "Make
    # Luneshines Appear in the Wild" option, or my own TPS Better Loot
    # mod are recommended.)
    #
    # WARNING: This mod will allow items to be spawned which will be
    # deleted by TPS if it's run without this mod active!  Be careful,
    # and be sure to Alt-F4 if you find you've lost an item, in the
    # hopes of exiting without saving over your savegame.
