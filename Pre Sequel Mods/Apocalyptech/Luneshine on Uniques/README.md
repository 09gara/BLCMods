Luneshine on Uniques
====================

Several unique/legendary weapons in TPS don't have any Luneshine attachments
specified in the game data, so they will never spawn with Luneshine.  This mod
fixes those, and additionally sets it up so that they will ALWAYS have
Luneshine, so long as you're doing something which allows Luneshine.  In order
to actually get most of these to have Luneshine, you'll need to also be using
something like UCP's "`Make Luneshines Appear in the Wild`" option (found in its
"`2.1 Optionals`" folder), or my own "TPS Better Loot" mod.

**WARNING:** This mod contains some statements which can generate gear which
the vanilla game doesn't think is valid.  If you have some of this gear in your
inventory and start the game without having this mod enabled, the engine will
remove those items from your inventory.  If you see this, be sure to `Alt-F4`
out of the game to prevent it from saving over your savegame.

Specifically, this mod alters the parts pool for the following weapons:

* Berrigan
* Black Snake
* Boomacorn
* Boss Nova
* Boxxy Gunn
* Cyber Eagle
* Party Line
* Plunkett
* T4s-R
* Too Scoops
* The ZX-1

Usage
=====

This mod must be imported into FilterTool/BLCMM with `Developer tools` ->
`Add single mod`.  Choose the file `Luneshine on Uniques` and have at it!

Mod Construction / Implementation Details
=========================================

This mod is actually generated using a simple little Python script named
`generate-mod.py`.  The script makes use of `hotfix.py` from Apocalyptech's
main BL2 mod directory.  You'd need to copy (or symlink, if you're on Mac
or Linux) `hotfix.py` into this directory in order to run the script.

Licenses
========

The `generate-source.py` script itself is licensed under the
[3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause),
which should be permissive enough to do just about whatever with.
