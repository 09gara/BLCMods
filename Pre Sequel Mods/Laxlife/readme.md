### How to use

First you will need to merge these files into your TPS Patch (patch.txt)

You can either manually do that or use the filtertool

[Filtertool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ4qI4U_lE0&t=1s/) - Get it here, it is recommended.


### [Buggy Replace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLCM/BLCMods/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Laxlife/BuggyReplace.txt)

```
Makes the Stingray have priority over the Moonbuggy in the spawn station, and changes the laser buggy into the Stingray. The missle buggy will remain as a buggy to prevent some softlocks and stuff.
```

### [One Click Refill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLCM/BLCMods/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Laxlife/oneclickrefill.txt)

```
Click on the what ammo type you want and it refills it fully. No more spamming right click
```
