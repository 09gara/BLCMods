### How to use

First you will need to merge these files into your TPS Patch (patch.txt)

You can either manually do that or use the filtertool

```
[Filtertool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ4qI4U_lE0&t=1s/) - Get it here, it is recommended.
```

### [Missel First](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLCM/BLCMods/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Laxlife/missilefirst.txt/)

```
This makes the Moonbuggy default to the Missle accessory
```

### One Click Refill

```
Click on the what ammo type you want and it refills it fully. No more spamming right click
```
