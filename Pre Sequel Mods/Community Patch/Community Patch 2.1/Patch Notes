General
1 Gave MoonStone Chest a chance at Legendaries (this will need some feedback I believe the current rates are "fair" for the price )

3 Tuned Down chubby spawnrates a tiny bit more. ( From 3% to 2% Note that is the chance for any stalker to be a chubby )

Key Difference of optionals and Customs.
Optionals are stuff that people asked But not everyone is gonna like. Customs are Custom made creation of members 
of the UCP team to make the game a bit more fun but not always balanced.
