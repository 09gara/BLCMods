Hello Folks Jim Raven here for a quick update time.
For starters i am indeed working on Version 2.0. i Am kinda alone in that proccess tho so it takes longer than expected.
Especially with Destiny2 Xcom War of the Chosen and some more games coming out.

ANYWAY

There is a new issue with TPS where Hotfix stuff ( meaning mostly skill changes) do not work.
I made a quick fix for it in The CommunityPatch.

If this still doesnt work for you USE the OFFLINE version.
In the Future there is a high chance i will be making offline versions only as they tend to work a lot better than the online ones 
and dont break when you are online or offline.
