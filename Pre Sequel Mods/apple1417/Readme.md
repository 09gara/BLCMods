### Experimental
As the name might suggest, contains experimental changes which you probably shouldn't run if you don't know what you're doing.

### Fast Travel Helper
Allows you re-enable the previously one-way only fast travel stations and lets you move them to any map without a station.    
Also has a few QoL changes to go along with these new stations:
- Re-orders the station order so that 00773 Vault Excavation Site comes right after Cluster 00773, rather than at the end of the list
- Re-enables the level transition from the Lunar Launching Station to the Eye of Helios
- Lets Flameknuckle respawn
- Lets Zarpedon respawn, optionally skipping the powersuit phase and adding its drops to the second phase
