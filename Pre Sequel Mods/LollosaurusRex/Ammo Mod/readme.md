### Ammo Mod 1.1 by Lollo for BL2 and TPS

With help from many people on the Shadowevil discord and the authors of the Unofficial Community Patch.

This modifies the amount of ammo you get from world pickups.

Each ammo type has several options for the amount you want. Most have x1 (default), x1.5, x2, and Ludicrous

Fully compatible with both BL2 and TPS

Thanks :)
