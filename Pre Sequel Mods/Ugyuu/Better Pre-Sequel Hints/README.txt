This file contains the INT file that replaces the loading screen hints on the English version of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.

[NOTES]

Best used if you have all characters, but not needed.
This replacement will revert it's changes if you check the integrity of the game cache, just like how it resets the hex-edit for the community patch.
Redownload if you need to.

[HOW TO INSTALL]

Close your game before doing this. It is best that you do this or it will not work.

Make a backup of your existing Subtitles.INT file before doing this. (It's in Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT) Put it somewhere safe.

Download the new Subtitles.INT and save it as; All Files. If you don't select All Files, it will save as a TXT, and you don't want that.

Copy the Subtitles.INT file included in this to BorderlandsPreSequel/WillowGame/Localization/INT and paste it there.If it notifies you that there already is a file with this name, choose to replace it instead.

Load your game and witness the better loading screen hints!

Enjoy.
