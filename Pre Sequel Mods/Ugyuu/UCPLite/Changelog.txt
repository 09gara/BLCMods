#############################################################################################

THIS CHANGELOG CONTAINS THE CHANGES MADE IN UCPLITE, WHICH ARE CHANGES MADE FROM THE PRE-SEQUEL COMMUNITY PATCH ITSELF.
THE CHANGELOG OF THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY PATCH CAN BE FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE.

#############################################################################################

Overall; COMPLETELY fixed grammar, typo and lower/capital case letter issues in the patch file.

Weapon changes:

- Buffed Cat O' Nine Tails to be slightly better in damage than it's purple counterpart, instead of equal to it.
- Gave the Probe an additional 5% life-steal, making it 25%.
- Nerfed the Spadroon's increased rate of gaining a continuous damage bonus (instantly gets it in the patch), but didn't remove it entirely.
- Nerfed the Too Scoop's projectile count back to 2, and also reduced it's damage. 4 projectiles may have been overkill.
- Buffed the ZX1's damage even more.

Luneshine changes:

- Serenity: Made it reduce oz consumption by about -2.5, which should be a boost of 1250%. Originally, the patch made it nigh impossible to lose oz without boosting.
- Punisher: Fixed the critical damage bonus changes, it is now properly 20%.
- Oxygenator: Originally restores 10 oz on each hit with the patch's luneshine, but now only restores 5. Still works best on weapons with high fire rate, just a bit more balanced.
- HardenUp: Now boosts shield capacity by 15% while the weapon is equipped.
- FastLearner: Hopefully makes XP boosts +40%.
- Boominator: Fixed the grenade damage bonus (hopefully), making it the proper 20%.
- Piercing Rounds: Boosted to 50% (was unchanged in the patch)

Grenade changes:

- Increased damage on Scav and Tediore grenades a little more than the patch.
- Buffed and nerfed the Snowball; more damage, but reduced it's elemental effect chance (should still be 100%)

Loot changes:

- Removed The Machine, Boomacorn and Ol'Painful from the Swagman, and added them like so;
  - The Machine is now an additional drop for the Kraggon Phonic.
  - The Boomacorn is now a reward for completing Voyage Of Captain Chef (The Bad Touch didn't fit at all)
  - Ol' Painful should be an optional reward for BoomShakalaka, so, you can choose for the Moonscaper of Ol' Painful.
- Added the Storm Front as a possible drop for killing Oscar (For all the Maelstrom Athena players out there :P )
- Removed the Flayer and Luck Cannon from the Denial Subroutine, as you can still farm those after completing the dlc, except from other sources (unlike the Laser Disker and Rerouter, which are very hard to farm after dlc completion)

Moxxtail changes:

- Reduced o2 consumption for the Oxygen Moxxtail to about -50% o2 consumption, from -99%.


==========

- Moved 2.1 optionals that are unsafe with sanity check to a seperate category inside of the same category.
