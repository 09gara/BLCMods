### Allegiance Forcer
This plugin generates a mod that forces allegiance towards a particular manufacturer. Weapons, shields, grenade modes, relics, and oz kits of incorrect manufacturers will no longer spawn, and class mods will be set to require different characters.

Includes optional settings to allow using the relevant allegiance relic, and to increase the value of money drops (to offset the reduced amount of weapon/item drops).

Supports both BL2 and TPS.
