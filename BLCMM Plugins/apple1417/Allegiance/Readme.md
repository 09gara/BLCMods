### Allegiance Forcer
This plugin generates a mod that forces allegiance towards a particular manufacturer. Weapons, shields, grenade modes, relics, and oz kits of incorrect manufacturers will be replaced with money drops, while class mods will still spawn but be unequippable.

Includes optional settings to allow using the relevant allegiance relic, to apply ontop of any mods you already have (in case they change item manufacturers), and to increase the value of money drops (as the money drops are worth less than the weapons).

Supports both BL2 and TPS.

THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THIS DELETES ITEMS ON EXISTING CHARACTERS.    
I've tried to prevent everything but certain individual items may still be deleted. Making sure you only ever execute the patch when you have your allegiance character selected will prevent this.
