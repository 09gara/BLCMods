## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate to give a look on it.

## [Redux] Double Quest Reward "Redux"

 - Green weapon/item reward upgraded to Blue weapon/item reward, so now the mission reward will be slightly better than the original game.
 - Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to a Blue weapon/item rewards for 9 missions (Main Game).
 - Choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one weapon/item, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts.
 - In the mission Uncle Teddy, if you give the plans to Hyperion you will have the choice between 2 options: The Bitch (Legendary SMG Hyperion) or The Commerce (Unique Shock SMG Hyperion)
 - Hammerlock's missions (in the Main Game) will be rewarded by a Jakobs weapon/item. (Coming -very!- Soon)
