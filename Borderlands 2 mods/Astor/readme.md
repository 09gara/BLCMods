### Double Quest Reward "Redux"

The main reason why I resurrected (and rebuild from scratch) the "Double Quest Reward" Mod is mainly because in the great Koby's original Mod (unfortunately now extinct), some Unique weapon/items (Lady Fist, Rocksalt, Dahlminator, Buffalo, Landscaper, Deadly Bloom, Sandhawk, Pimpernel, etc...) where removed from the rewards, and that doesn't make sense to me.

The case of the removal from the Lady Fist upset me, because during the mission Uncle Teddy, just after finding the 6th echo, Una Baha say: 

> "Great - that was just what I was hopin' to hear! Now, if you can find the blueprints for the weapon design they ripped off, I'll give you the first gun my uncle ever gave me." 

By saying "I'll give you the first gun my uncle ever gave me", it make sense to me that she will give her personal weapon given by T.K. Baha: the Lady Fist (in reference, as red text refers, to the Lady Finger, a gun retrieved from the grave of T.K. Baha's wife in Borderlands 1) as reward instead of any Blue Hyperion pistol. 

Now, Una will offer the Lady Fist, which is a Hyperion pistol, while Hyperion will offer The Bitch (or The Commerce if you choose this option) which are both Hyperion SMG... but in any case the Tidal Wave, like in the original game, who was ironically a Jakobs weapon!

The Tidal Wave, which apparently is not a weapon reward anywhere anymore is now becoming a reward for the mission "Capture The Flag" in Sawtooth Cauldron (which previously doesn't give any weapon/item as reward, but just the "Jakobs Family Skin" customization)

Note: For those who were familiar with the previous Mod, the weapon/Item marked with a (*) are upgrade (like the Bitch/Commerce in Uncle Teddy), new rewards (like the Tidal Wave in Capture The Flag) or restored Unique weapon/item "gone" in the original Koby's Mod. 

In the future, more addition, like upgrade from Green to Blue weapon/item rewards, will be done in this Mod (who by the way is my first one), but only when I will find some free time, so stay tuned :wink:
