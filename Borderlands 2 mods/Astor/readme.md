## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate to give a look on it.

## [Quest Reward] Double Quest Reward "Redux"

 - Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to a Blue weapon/item rewards for 9 missions.
 - Choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a Unique weapon/item with desired parts.
 - In the mission Uncle Teddy, if you give the plans to Hyperion you will have the choice between 2 options: The Bitch (Legendary SMG Hyperion) or The Commerce (Unique Shock SMG Hyperion)
