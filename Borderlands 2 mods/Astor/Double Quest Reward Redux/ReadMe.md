## Double Quest Reward "Redux"

### What do this mod?

 - This Mod will give you the choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts... and reduce the time spent doing "farming".
 - Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to a Blue weapon/item rewards for 9 missions, because once you (already) get them during the 1st playthrough, you don't care anymore

The main reason why I resurrected (and rebuild from scratch) the "Double Quest Reward" Mod is mainly because in the great Koby's original Mod -unfortunately now extinct!-, some Unique weapon/items (Lady Fist, Rocksalt, Dahlminator, Buffalo, Landscaper, Deadly Bloom, Sandhawk, Pimpernel, etc...) where removed from the rewards, and that doesn't make sense to me.

The case of the removal from the Lady Fist really upset me, because during the mission Uncle Teddy, just after finding the 6th echo, Una Baha say: 

 > *"Great - that was just what I was hopin' to hear!* 
 > *Now, if you can find the blueprints for the weapon design they ripped off, I'll give you the first gun my uncle ever gave me."* 

By saying "I'll give you the first gun my uncle ever gave me", it make sense to me that she will give her personal weapon given by T.K. Baha (the Lady Fist, as red text refers, in reference to the Lady Finger, a gun retrieved from the grave of T.K. Baha's wife in Borderlands 1) as reward instead of any Blue Hyperion pistol. 

Now, Una will offer the Lady Fist, which is a Hyperion pistol, while Hyperion will offer The Bitch (or The Commerce if you choose this option) which are both Hyperion SMG... but in any case the Tidal Wave, like in the original game, who was ironically a Jakobs weapon!

The Tidal Wave, which apparently is not a weapon reward anywhere anymore is now becoming a reward for the mission "Capture The Flag" in Sawtooth Cauldron (which previously doesn't give any weapon/item as reward, but just the "Jakobs Family Skin" customization)

### Note: 

For those who were familiar with the previous Mod, the weapon/Item marked with a (*) are:
 - Upgrade (like the Bitch/Commerce in Uncle Teddy) 
 - New Unique weapon/item rewards (like the Tidal Wave in Capture The Flag) 
 - ... or restored Unique weapon/item rewards "gone" in the original Koby's Mod. 
 
Feel Free to use the BLCMM tool to pick the option of your choice.

### Other Recommended Mods:

There's a few things which I'd considered adding to this mod, but were already well-covered in other mods, so instead I'll just mention them here.

- [GearboxGunsPlus](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/eca477d33671be540718c816662cb08f4f0ad1cd/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Gear%20Packs/GearboxGunsPlus.txt) by [Aaron0000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : His Mod spruces up the Gearbox guns (include the ~~crappy pistol~~ Basic Repeater) and changes the rarity of the Gearbox weapons (Assault Rifle, SMG & Sniper Rifle) to Blue.

- [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) : His Mod give you weapon/item rewards above 'Green' level up to a Legendary, and does NOT replaces unique rewards.

### Credits:

- This mod was totally build from scratch, but was strongly inspired by the -unfortunately now defunct!- "Double Quest Rewards" Mod initially created by Koby (among many others great Mods), hence the "Redux" in its name.

### Changelog:

### To do:

- [x] Bring back some Unique weapon/Item as mission rewards for the main game
- [x] Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to weapon/item rewards for the main game
- [ ] Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to weapon/item rewards for the DLCs


So, yes... in the future, more addition will be done in this Mod (who by the way is my first one), but only when I will find some free time, so stay tuned :wink:
