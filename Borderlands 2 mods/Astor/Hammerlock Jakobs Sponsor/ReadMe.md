## Hammerlock Jakobs Sponsor

### What do this mod?

- The Mission given by Hammerlock in the main game will be rewarded with a Jakobs weapon/item
- This Mod will give you the choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts... and reduce the time spent doing "farming".
  - In the Mission Bad Hair Day (Southern Shelf) the reward is now a Blue Shotgun Torgue (if the fur is given to Clap-Trap) or a Blue Sniper Jakobs (if the fur is given to Hammerlock)
    - The reward for the other missions given by Hammerlock are now rewarded by a Blue Jakobs weapon/item:   
    - Mighty Morphin' (Tundra Express)
    - Perfectly Peaceful (Caustic caverns)   
    - Shielded Favors (Southern Shelf)	  
    - Symbiosis (Southern Shelf)	  
    - The Name Game (Three Horns - Divide)
