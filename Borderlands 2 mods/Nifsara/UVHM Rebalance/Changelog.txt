2018/01/11: v.1.0 - Initial release

        This mod is far from finished. I've spent more time in the Filter Tool than I have in-game. Things are probably going to be very unbalanced until I play through the game or get some feedback at various level brackets.

2018/01/11: v.1.01

        Badass health nerfed somewhat due to bosses and no Slag bonus damage. Needs further testing.
        
2018/01/11: v.1.1

        Major update already?!
        
        -Enemy health and shield balanced for real. Let me know if it's okay now.
        -Movement speed penalty when slagged increased to 100% (halving movement speed).
        -Slag on shield damage buffed to 0.9.
        -Slag has been given a hidden multiplicative bonus of 25% chance to be applied universally (except on player).
        -Double ammo drop didn't work.
