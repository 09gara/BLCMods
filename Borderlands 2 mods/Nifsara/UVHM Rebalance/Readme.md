*UVHM Rebalance*</br> by Nifsara</br>

This mod overhauls both UVHM and Slag into being less stressful to manage by removing the health regeneration of enemies and making Slag a non-damage debuff. In turn, enemies have received a large increase in health to compensate.

***

I recommend using this mod together with Level1UVHM, which you can download at [Koby's Github.](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Koby/Level%201%20UVHM)</br>
It's not a requirement, however. You just won't experience UVHM at low levels.

<dl><dt>To install:</dt>
<dd>Add this mod with the Filter Tool.</dd>
<dd>Move <b>Difficulty</b> to the bottom as it touches enemy scaling.
<dd>Place <b>Slag Control</b> as high up as possible, except for mods that require being at the very top (UCP, for example).</br>
Make sure to turn off any other mod(s) touching Slag (e.g. B33PB00PJOE's <em>Slag Overhaul</em>, which is present in BL2Reborn).
<dd>If you're a masochist, try playing through 1-50 with both <em>Enemy Enhancer</em> and <em>UVHM+</em> active.</dd></dl>
