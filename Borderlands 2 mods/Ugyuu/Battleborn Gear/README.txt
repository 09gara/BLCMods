FOR EVERY KIND OF BADASS

This is a collection of gear representing some Battleborn characters.

This gear is made to replicate the character, it's weapon and the skills that they use, all put into the single gear piece made for them.

Melee characters not included.
Multiple are not included, as the skills are very hard to replicate.
Ambra may be included, but will be made in The Pre-Sequel if she does get gear made after her.

Checklist: "-> DONE" = Finished gear; "?" = Uncertainty in if this becomes gear or not; "??????" Super secret bonus gear at the end, once all other gear is done.
