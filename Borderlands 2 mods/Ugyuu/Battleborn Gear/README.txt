FOR EVERY KIND OF BADASS

This is a collection of gear representing some Battleborn characters.

Note: These weapons can be very powerful. Use at your own risk of losing / gaining fun.

This gear is made to replicate the character, it's weapon and the skills that they use, all put into the single gear piece made for them.

Melee characters not included.
Multiple are not included, as the skills are very hard to replicate.
Ambra may be included, but will be made in The Pre-Sequel if she does get gear made after her.

Checklist: "-> DONE" = Finished gear; "?" = Uncertainty in if this becomes gear or not; "??????" Super secret bonus gear at the end, once all other gear is done.

Beatrix -> DONE
Benedict -> DONE
Caldarius -> DONE

Oscar Mike (Possibly cancelled.)

There may be a possibility to have these weapons change their firing modes with a binding in the far future, if i'm not lazy. I'm unsure however.
