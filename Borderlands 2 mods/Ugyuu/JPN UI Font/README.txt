This file contains the font replacement for the English version of Borderlands 2. It will replace the original font by a better one, in my opinion. It is easier to read, and doesn't clutter as much.

[HOW TO INSTALL]

Make sure you are not running the game while doing this. It's for safety.

Make a backup of your existing GFxUI.INT before doing this! (It's in Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT) Put it somewhere safe.

Copy the new GFxUI.INT to Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT and Paste it in that folder. If it notifies you that there already is a file with this name, choose to replace it instead.

Reload your game and the font will be changed to the different one. 

Enjoy!
