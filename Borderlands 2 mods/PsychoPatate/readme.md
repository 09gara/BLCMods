#Hi !

I'm PsychoPatate,
that would be PsychoTato in English, but I'm French.

This readme is just here so you know that there are readme files in every mod folder I'll make.

And here is a quick synopsis :

##Proper Weapon Bodies
- Swaps green and blue weapon bodies because it makes more sense that way.
- Allows you to change some weapon bodies because they have unique bodies so why not.
- ONLY VISUAL CHANGES, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.
---
##Matching Barrels
- Changes every unique weapon barrel so it matches its manufacturer (Sand Hawk gets a Dahl barrel).
- But doesn't change **all** barrels because some wouldn't make sense anymore.
- ONLY VISUAL CHANGES, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.
