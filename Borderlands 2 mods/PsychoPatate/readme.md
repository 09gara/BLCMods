# Hi !

I'm PsychoPatate,
that would be PsychoTato in English, but I'm French.

This readme is just here so you know that there are readme files in every mod folder I'll make.

I mainly do visual mods and skins, and here is a quick synopsis :

## Proper Weapon Bodies
- Swaps green and blue weapon bodies because it makes more sense that way.
- Allows you to change some weapon bodies because they have unique bodies so why not.
- **ONLY VISUAL CHANGES, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.**

---
## Matching Barrels
- Changes every unique weapon barrel so it matches its manufacturer (Sand Hawk gets a Dahl barrel).
- But doesn't change **all** barrels because some wouldn't make sense anymore.
- **ONLY VISUAL CHANGES, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.**

---
## No Glow On Non-Elemental Gemstone
- Removes the orange glow on non-elemental gemstone weapons.

---
## Actual Rolling Thunder
- Simple changes to the Rolling Thunder that makes it decent (I think).

---
## Skins
- Cleaner and/or colorful reskin of some weapons : **[Images](https://imgur.com/a/xyvMPoa)**
- Skins for weapons that doesn't already have a skin. **[Images](https://imgur.com/a/Z7q5ma1)**
