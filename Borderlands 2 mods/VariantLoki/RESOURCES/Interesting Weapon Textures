One of my favroite parts of Modding weapons is making weapon skins. I'm always trying to make cool skins, and use interesting textures  to make them unique
Taking a look though Dave's Texture folder, I decided to try some of the textures and see what works as skins.
These are some of the more interesting, or weird, or fun ones I found.
Experiment with them. Im sure they can make for very nice skins!

THINGS TO KNOW
  1. Place these in the Decal channel of your weapon skin. Some might work in the pattern channel, but most will just appear pitch black.
  2. Generally you're going to want to have "UseFullColorDecal" set to 0
  3. The majority of these will be tiled/repeating patterns unless otherwise specified.
