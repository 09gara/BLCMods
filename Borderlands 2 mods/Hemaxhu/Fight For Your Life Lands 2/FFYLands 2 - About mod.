About mod:
Sometimes it can be too hard, especially in Digi-Peak area. This is why it is RECOMMENDED to be played in co-op
In solo mode you will probably suffer
You can even ragequit
Bosses will restore their hp, you will die over and over
Be ready for it if you are playing this mod in solo
You may not like some difficulty increases ['Artifical play-rates, 2hard4me, mod sucks'], but it's up to you.












Some 'important' info:

It took me like 1 year to create and release this mod
I started to create it from the first version of community patch, from the beginning it was just gun edits, then i learned how to edit some stuff (Like skills, enemies).
Time passed, now you can see what i created.
