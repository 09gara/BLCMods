This mod is a HUGE \mod-pack?\. It will increase loading times to about 10-15 seconds. There are a lot of changes. From guns to skill trees and edited enemies
This mod is not designed for modifications in Filter Tool.
But you can still select optional changes in 'Optional Changes' section [FT]
Recommended to play without other global mods (To avoid conflicts)
But if you decided to play it with other mods - put FFYLands 2 last in mod order.

About mod:
Increased game difficulty [Optional difficulties in Filter Tool: Hardcore, Hard, Medium, Easy. Hardcore by default]
Recommended to be played in co-op mode
Enemies can have any gun \ shield
Increased 'animation speed' for almost all enemies
Increased spawn rates for most enemies \ badass enemies
98% of legendary drops are locked until level 49. Don't try to farm for legendary gear until this level if you don't know who can drop stuff.
Added \ reworked a lot of new gear
Added \ reworked character skills
Changed all skill trees
All characters now have their unique abilities. As example Axton sprints faster than others.

Contains almost all of my mods, so you don't need to add them to FFYLands2. [More Chests On Pandora, etc]



Non-Important info:
Sometimes it can be too hard, especially in Digi-Peak area. This is why it is RECOMMENDED to be played in co-op
In solo mode you will probably suffer
You can even ragequit
Bosses will restore their hp, you will die over and over
Be ready for it if you are playing this mod in solo
You may not like some difficulty increases ['Artifical play-rates, 2hard4me, mod sucks'], but it's up to you.

Tip: some bosses can destroy you. [And force you to ragequit]
Make sure to be prepared with a good gear before going to a Willhelm as example.
