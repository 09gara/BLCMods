# Overview

The **Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf** nerfs Cloud Kill, uh well, dynamically.

In other words, Cloud Kill gets nerfed *a lot* in the early levels, and *a lot less* (or pretty much not at all) in the end game. Several options are available.

# Compatibility

The Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf is compatible with the Skill Scaling Patch.
It should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch Cloud Kill and/or Blight Phoenix.
If they do touch Cloud Kill and/or Blight Phoenix, it will probably still be fine as long as you add the Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf at the end.

(Note that, in practice, Blight Phoenix is left unchanged by this mod.. it did lose a few of its internal organs, but with no noticeable consequences).

# Options

**Normal Maya**    
Cloud Kill does about 10% of its damage at level 16, 18% at level 30, 41% at level 50, 79% at level 72, 95% at OP8.

**True Maya**    
Cloud Kill does about 10% of its damage at level 16, 17% at level 30, 36% at level 50, 65% at level 72, 78% at OP8.

**Ultimate Maya**    
Cloud Kill does about 7% of its damage at level 16, 12% at level 30, 27% at level 50, 52% at level 72, 63% at OP8.

# Known Issues

The Cloud Kill damage ends up being in part calculated from the level of the game, rather than the level of Maya herself.
For example, if you join the game of a lower/higher level player, your Cloud Kill damage will adapt (to some extent), and be lower/higher than it should.
I don't think this should be too problematic in practice.

# Credits

This was all written by me.

Thanks to the Order of the Impending Storm for balancing Cloud Kill so well in the first place.
