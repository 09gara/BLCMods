**Phaselock damage on non-phaselockable targets**: made to scale like other skills.   
* Damage increase of +60% at level 30, +100% at level 50, +144% at 72, +160% at OP8

**Ruin**: made to scale like other skills and removed the level 72 cap.    
* Damage increase of +60% at level 30, +100% at level 50, +144% at 72, +590% at OP8.    
* This also affects the Corrode DOT (but not the main damage) from Cloud Kill. Since the DOT is very small, this has practically no effect on the overall Cloud Kill damage (about +1.5% at OP8).
