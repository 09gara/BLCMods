### Item Level Uncapper
This mod is useless by itself, it should be used alongside the hexedit to increase the player level cap.    
Fixes the level cap of most items so that they continue spawning past level 100.    
Note that items past level 127 will overflow upon save-quit, and that gibbed won't let you create items past 127, so past that point you'll have to pick up everything you use within the same session.    
Also note that there may still be various other issues with an increased level cap, this only fixes that most items stopped spawning.
