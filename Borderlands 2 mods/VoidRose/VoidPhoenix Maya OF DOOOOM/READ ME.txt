################# Glamorous Prism Dancer ############################
the Glamorous Prism Dancer is the little sister of my first modded weapon The Elegance it has THREE different firing modes and each mode has a different effect as well as pattern and color... the way to switch firing modes is pressing the "O","P" or "H" keys which set a new firing mode.
"O" = Veruc Firing Mode which is good for sniping and when it hits a hard surface it ricochets and spawns orbs.
"P" = Storm Firing Mode - Has a Cyan Spiral which is quite accurate and has an all elemental splash damage and 100% chance to DOT.
"H" = Thunder ball fists Firing Mode has a green color and spirial and spawns Fireworks on impact.


Holding the Prism Dancer reduces your shield by alot great for the hide of terra and backdraft.
While ADSing youre mag becomes 18 and you can fire fully automatic.
Increases Jump Height and while ADSing you can superjump.
################# The Phoenix's flame ###############################
replaces the TeaPot. sets the cooldown of scorn to 0 while holding and icreases its damage...Spam for some awesome damage and feel like a WIZARD. cant shoot just mods some stats for your character such as slag damage and crit damage also adds jump height .

################# BLOSSOM OF THE NIGHT ############################## 
#### +5 in Helios, Recompense, Backdraft, BlightPhoenix, and Kinetic Reflection. + increased Incendiary and Corrosive dot damage and sets kill skill duration to unlimited
####



################# PLAY STYLE ##############################
### the play style of this build/mod is meant to be to unequip your weapons except the Phoenix's Flame and Glamorous Prism Dancer alternating between firing awesome magic bullets or spaming your siren powers with a combo of scorn, converge, blightphoenix, ruin, backdraft and THE OG GOD ITSELF>>> CLOUDKILL. 

## i like to use the Hide of terra for double novas and extra roid for your Prism Dancers Bayonet.
