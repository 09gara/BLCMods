#Gears

currently contains 2 custom weapons and 2 existing gear change

-existing gear change

	1. Auto-booster.txt
  
	  makes regular boosters and Big Boom Blaster booster auto-pickup, but slightly reduces the shield regen to make up for it
  
	  WTF now shoots out two boosters instead of one to compensate for lessened shield regen(you still cant auto-pick up WTF boosters as itd prevent it from shooting out the shock grenades)
	  
	2. LessBlindingFotFH.txt
	
	  lessens the nova effects of FotFH-will most likely affect all Fire Novas unfortunately 

    3. Better grenades.txt
  
      my attempts to make some not-so-popular grenades better
        currently improves:
          -Contraband Skyrocket: makes it scale to OP8, and child explosions deal 50% self damage to you
          -Breath of Terramorphous: slight singularity effect on initial explosion, doubled the projectiles
          -Nasty Surprise: x2 grenades per drop, child grenades explode as soon as they spawn, increased status effect chance
          -Rolling Thunder: increased radius for bounce explosions(x2.25) and bounce explosions will not harm you, while staggering enemies. Additionally, gave it a 30% damage buff
          -Homing Grenades: x2 homing speed
	  -Tediore Grenades: now regen grenades based on Rarity(Thanks to Orudeon for allowing me to incorporate this from his TedioreBrandOverhaul!)
	  -O Negative: reverts the community patch's buff of lessening its fuse time, but adds 5 more child grenades to it to compensate(once again Thanks to Orudeon for allowing me to incorporate this from his MaliwanBrandTweaks!)
	  -MIRVs: makes the child grenades shoot up less, reducing the term between the two explosions while making it less spread out.
	  -Kiss of Death: Increases fuse time to 10 seconds(this makes it so that the grenade will damage enemies for longer), and increases the damage it does while attached by 50%
    
	4. Splash.txt
	
	   reduces the visual pollution of explosion effects by
		-halving the effect size
		-removing some particle effects
    


-custom weapons

	1. Nidhogg.txt-last updated:5/3(now has a skin)
  
	  Changes the creamer to resemble the BL1 Nidhogg(aka fires a rocket that explodes after a set time, releasing 6 smaller rockets downward)
  
      removes the Moxxi healing as well
      
 
	2. Heimdall.txt-last updated:5/9 (v3.1 makes the skin a bit more olive-ish, no changes other than that so if you like the previous skin better use the v3)
	
      replaces the Evil Smasher, my take at sth that resembles the BL1 Ogre/AjaxOgre(probably closer to AjaxOgre)
	
      accurate, fast firing explosive rifle
