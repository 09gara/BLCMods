### Personal Policy ###
you are free to use my mods in your modpack or whatever it may be without asking my permission
however, please acknowledge the work as being mine and give the necessary credits (with a visible name, dont just say 'its not my work' and be done with it)
a link to my folder would also be appreciated but that's up to you, I wouldn't really mind if you dont do it :P




### Installation notes ###

the ones without the (hotfix) are the console command version code
they can be executed as separate.txts, but they have to applied once your inside the game with the character(Krieg in this case)
and it has to be executed every single time you load up the character(aka it will be reset whenever you exit to the main menu)


the ones with (hotfix) are the hotfix version codes
you will not have to execute them everytime you load the game but they cannot be run as a separate file
they have to be put in the main Community Patch file


### Merging/Filter tool ###
now you can use LightChaosman's incredible Filter tool to merge hotfixes/mods instead of going through the cumbersome process of doing it manually!

for how to use and download

### Hotfix Merging ###

the hotfix files will be formatted like this:

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("A")

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("a")


in the main Community Patch file

there should also be sections that say

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("B","C","D","E",....)

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("b","c","d","e",...)

put "A" and "a" (including the quotation marks) inside the parantheses for each respective line

ex:

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("A","B","C","D","E",....)

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("a","b","c","d","e",...)

and execute the file in the main menu
