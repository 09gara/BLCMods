#####Enemy Enhancer#####

how to install

part 1 is the hotfix part of the mod
choose between Enemy Enhancer and Enemy Enhancer Extreme, and merge them into your community patch hotfix array(you can see how to merge hotfix below)
after youre done merging the hotfix

part 2 is the non-hotfix part of the mod
choose between EE.txt and EE(Speed).txt (if you reaaally dont want to, you can actually not use either, but I personally recommend it if youre in it for the challenge)
and just execute it after you execute the community patch


what it does: 

Enemy Enhancer- 
1. gives enemy better guns as your OP level goes up
enemies may spawn with blue/purple/etech/even red text(unique/seraph/legendary/pearlescent) guns, and you will rarely see enemies using white or green gear on OP8

2. some enemies may spawn with blue/purple/Legendary shields

3. makes some bandits roll faster and stagger for a shorter duration

Enemy Enhancer Extreme-

1.whats in Enemy Enhancer
2.every enemy may spawn with blue/purple/Legendary shields (Warning: THIS INCLUDES RAID BOSSES)

EE.txt- 
1. reduces DoT buff to +150% instead of +250% and increases Maliwan SMG/Pistol DoT to compensate
2. increases badass health and shields by about 50%
3. gives enemy double shield recharge rate(not delay/capacity, just rate)
4. (hopefully) increases enemy accuracy
5. reduces enemy gun damage and DoT damage a bit to compensate for much better guns and more frequent DoTs

EE(Speed).txt
1. whats in EE.txt
2. increases player movement speed by 20%(multiplicative)
3. increases enemy movement speed by 50% and gives them 10% bullet speed

###How to merge Hotfix###
the ones without the (hotfix) are the console command version code
they can be executed as separate.txts, but they have to applied once your inside the game with the character(Krieg in this case)
and it has to be executed every single time you load up the character(aka it will be reset whenever you exit to the main menu)


the ones with (hotfix) are the hotfix version codes
you will not have to execute them everytime you load the game but they cannot be run as a separate file
they have to be put in the main Community Patch file


the hotfix files will be formatted like this:

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("A")

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("a")


in the main Community Patch file

there should also be sections that say

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("B","C","D","E",....)

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("b","c","d","e",...)

put "A" and "a" (including the quotation marks) inside the parantheses for each respective line

ex:

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("A","B","C","D","E",....)

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("a","b","c","d","e",...)

and execute the file in the main menu
