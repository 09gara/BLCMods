#####UVHM+#####

how to install

UVHM+ is modularized to an extent, meaning you can choose what to use

EnemyEnhancer/Badassify/Vendor+ are hotfix parts of the mod

	choose between the regular and Extreme version(or choose not to use either), and merge them into your community patch hotfix array(you can see how to merge hotfix below)
	after youre done merging the hotfix

UVHM+ base is the non-hotfix part of the mod

	choose between UVHM+.txt and UVHM+(Speed).txt (once again you can choose not to use either, but I personally recommend it if youre in it for the challenge)
	and just execute it after you execute the community patch

###How to merge Hotfix###
the ones without the (hotfix) are the console command version code
they can be executed as separate.txts, but they have to applied once your inside the game with the character(Krieg in this case)
and it has to be executed every single time you load up the character(aka it will be reset whenever you exit to the main menu)

# Merging/Filter tool #
now you can use LightChaosman's incredible Filter tool to merge hotfixes/mods instead of going through the cumbersome process of doing it manually!

#How to merge Hotfix Manually#
the ones with (hotfix) are the hotfix version codes
you will not have to execute them everytime you load the game but they cannot be run as a separate file
they have to be put in the main Community Patch file


the hotfix files will be formatted like this:

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("A")

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("a")


in the main Community Patch file

there should also be sections that say

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("B","C","D","E",....)

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("b","c","d","e",...)

put "A" and "a" (including the quotation marks) inside the parantheses for each respective line

ex:

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Keys ("A","B","C","D","E",....)

set Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 Values ("a","b","c","d","e",...)

and execute the file in the main menu
