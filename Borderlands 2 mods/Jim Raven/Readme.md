and match whatever option you like
Features : Vendors No longer sell white and green gear. Instead they sell blue and purple accordingly.

Ups the Quantity of Grenade vendors items as it was a Random Number from 3 to 6
Vendors Now have a 10% chance at a LEGENDARY Item of the Day and 90% at Purple
HEAVILLY RECCOMENDED TO INSTALL WITH LIGHT'S TOOL AS IT EDITS HOTFIX THUS UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO MERGE USE THE TOOL!!!

# EXP+
A really simple Mod. it ups the exp you get when you are Below the enemy's you kill level making it so you can just rush Normal Mode and TVHM without having to worry about doing sides.

# FarmFest
 Makes Farming A lot Less tedious and A ALOT FASTER
 You should only use this when you are farming for Best parts or really wanna exp fast 
 As it does affect spawnrates of enemies as well
 Features: 1000% drop rate. THAT DOESNT MEAN ENEMIES WILL DROP 10 STUFF JUST THAT IT WILL ALWAY
 DROP ON KILL	
 Respawn of all enemies after 5 seconds. NOTE SOME ENEMIES JUST REFUSE TO RESPAWN LIKE BOLL.
 Vendors Will have legendaries "Almost" All the time
 
 # Legendary Anarchist
 Uh this is litteraly my very first mod ever and thus is not perfect by any means :P I might someday fix the UI now that i know how.
 It does one thing tho that i believe gaige players WOULD love and that is :
 
 Removes Strenght of Five Gorillas And Replaces Preshrunk Cyberpunk on the Legendary Anarchist Class mod.
 A melee Boost made no sense to that CoM so i gave it an Actual anarchy skill
 UI WONT SHOW IT BUT THE SKILL IS INDEED BUFFED IF YOU GO TO SKILL LIST
