BL2 Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech
===================================

This mod aims to make loot in Borderlands 2 "better" in general.  It's
essentially a cheat mod, intended for those BL2 players like myself who
tend to play in Normal most of the time, dislike grinding, get bored easily
by the uninteresting and drab loot that typically gets dropped in-game, and
who often end up just resorting to Gibbed to be able to play around with
some better gear.  The goal, personally, was to get the loot drops in-game
to a point where I never felt tempted to open up Gibbed.

This patch is set up to play nicely with FilterTool, and basically
everything in here can be toggled on or off inside FilterTool as you'd
hope, on an item-by-item basis.  Basically every bullet point in the
"Overview" section is its own "folder" once imported into FilterTool.

Usage/Installation
------------------

The recommended way to use this mod is with FilterTool/UCP.  In FilterTool,
select `Developer Tools` -> `Add Single Mod` and then select the file
file `BL2 Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech - UCP Compat` (without any
extensions).  You'll have a new folder for this mod underneath the `mods`
folder at the bottom, and can turn parts on or off at will.

If for whatever reason you don't want to use FilterTool, there is also
a standalone version at `BL2 Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech - Standalone`.
Simply copy that file into the game's `steamassets/binaries` directory with
an easy-to-type filename, and then run `exec <filename>` from the console
to load it on its own.  It works quite well by itself.

The only actual differences between the two versions are that the "Standalone"
version contains all of the original Gearbox hotfix data, and sets up the
hotfix commands for execution by Borderlands, whereas the "UCP Compat"
version lets FilterTool/UCP take care of that for you.

Both versions are fully FilterTool compatible.

Mod Overview
------------

Specifically, this mod does the following:

* Adds all legendaries/uniques/pearls/seraph items (weapons, grenade mods,
  class mods, shields, relics) into the global "legendary" loot pools, so
  you'll start seeing those much more frequently.
* Loot will skew much more rare, in general.  You should expect to see
  those legendaries/uniques/pearls/seraphs far more frequently than in
  vanilla BL2.
* "Regular" treasure chests will always provide at least blue-rarity gear,
  and has a decent chance of including stuff from the legendary pools.
* "Epic" treasure chests have an extremely high probability of dropping
  from the legendary pools.
* Dice Chests (from the Tiny Tina DLC) will have a small chance of containing
  legendary loot on a "very high" roll.
* When lockers spawn gear, they will always be blue-rarity.  *(Previously
  lockers had a chance to spawn even legendaries, so some could potentially
  see this as a drawback)*
* Adds the "Alignment" Class Mods from the Dragon Keep DLC into the global
  Class Mod drop pools (and makes those COMs always drop at at least blue
  rarity).
* Adds Gemstone-rarity weapons into the E-Tech weapon pools.
* Darts and Spikers drop far less frequently in the E-Tech pools.  *(I
  suspect this might annoy some folks; I could probably be convinced to
  undo that)*
* Makes Eridium drop 3x more often
* Makes Torgue Tokens more numerous when dropped
* Bosses are guaranteed to drop as many items from their legendary/unique
  pool as are in that pool.
  * Bosses with just a single unique/legendary drop will therefore be
    guaranteed to drop that item.
  * If a boss has more than one in their drop pool, you may get duplicates
    of one rather than one of each.
* Raid Bosses will drop better loot, and will drop as many legendary/unique/etc
  items as are in their pool.  (Seraph Crystal drops are increased as well,
  and Guardians will drop Seraph Crystals even in Normal mode).
* Fixes/Changes to some enemies' drop pools:
  * Some "Badass" enemies weren't actually pulling from the badass drop pool,
    which has been fixed:
    * Badass Boroks
    * Badass Knights
    * Badass Fire Archers
    * Undead Badass Psychos
    * Badass Yeti
  * A few more standard enemies have also been set to drop from the badass pool:
    * Bulstross
    * Arguk the Butcher
    * Skeleton Giants *(as if the Dragon Keep DLC needed more loot)*
    * Individual Handsome Sorcerer stage bosses
    * Bridget Hodunk and Colin Zaford *(from the Wedding Day Massacre Headhunter Pack)*
    * Giant Craboid
  * Then a few other tweaks to certain enemies:
    * Witch Doctors (both in Big Game Hunt and Son of Crawmerax) will drop an Eridium
      stick, and have a pretty good chance of dropping a Relic as well.
    * Elite Savages are guaranteed to drop loot (though just from the standard pool)
    * Most Tributes from the Wattle Gobbler Headhunter Pack were set to drop from
      the badadss loot pool, but three weren't set to drop any loot at all.  This
      mod fixes the three to have them drop as well.
    * The Loot Leprechaun (from Wedding Day Massacre) will drop from the Epic Chest
      pool, rather than the regular treasure chest pool.
    * The BLNG Loader (from Wedding Day Massacre) will drop from the badass pool and
      also drop a whole bunch of money.  I've always been mystified why it didn't
      drop a ton of money from the start.
* Remove early-game loot restrictions.  This is actually a superset of the
  similar feature already present in UCP 4.0.  This version enables spawning
  of basically everything from the beginning, including all grenade types,
  relics, class mods, rocket launchers, etc.  Both this and the UCP 4.0
  "Remove Loot restriction in the beginning areas" mods can be active at the
  same time with no ill effects -- it'll just mean that the relevant commands
  get executed twice.  Note that if you *don't* have either this or UCP
  enabled on your game, the early game will end up dropping *no* gear, due
  to our rarity changes.
* Optionally, I've left in some statements which cause all enemies to
  always drop gear, and always drop five items rather than just one.  This
  is disabled by default and would have to be enabled manually via FilterTool
  -- I'd basically just been using them to test out my custom loot pools by
  having a larger sample size.

Compatibility
-------------

This mod is mostly compatible with UCP 4.0, with three known exceptions:

* "Better Enemy Drops / Regular Enemy Drop Improvements / BLNG Loader" in this
  mod will override UCP's "Loot Pool & Drop Changes / Specific Loot Changes /
  Add Sledge's Shotgun to BLNG Loader"
* "Better Enemy Drops / Raid Boss Drop Improvements / Hyperius" in this mod
  will override UCP's "Loot Pool & Drop Changes / Specific Loot Changes / Add
  Black Hole and remove the Kiss of Death from Hyperius"
* "Better Enemy Drops / Raid Boss Drop Improvements / Hyperius / Clean Up
  Seraph Drop Pool" in this mod will override the loot pool changes in UCP's
  "Loot Pool & Drop Changes / Specific Loot Changes / Increase Hyperius' Seraph
  drop chance and add all DLC 1 Seraphs".  Unselecting just "Clean Up Seraph
  Drop Pool" in this mod but leaving the rest of our Hyperius section intact
  will still give a 100% drop rate for Seraphs on Hyperius.

It's possible that there are some other strange interactions which could take
place when both UCP and this mod are active, though it shouldn't be anything
awful.

Obviously this mod will conflict with other mods which play with the same
variables.  I know that Hemaxhu's "Better White Chests" would conflict with
this, for instance, and possibly other mods in Hemaxhu's "Chest Mods"
folder.  FromDarkHell's collection in the "Loot Drops" folder likewise will
probably conflict.

In terms of loot compatibility, I'm pretty sure that this mod makes the
"Vault Hunter's Relic" completely useless, but if you're using this mod,
you certainly won't miss it.

Loot Purposefully Excluded from Pools
-------------------------------------

There's some gear which I felt shouldn't be in the pools at all.  I am
quite willing to hear counterarguments; my mind could probably be pretty
easily persuaded otherwise if someone feels strongly about it.

* Cracked Sash (Shield)
* GOTY/Preorder/Whatever starting game loot:
  * "Gearbox" themed guns (AR/SMG/Sniper)
  * Contraband Sky Rocket
  * Vault Hunter's Relic
* Captain Blade's Midnight Star
* Blue-rarity Magic Missile *(purple rarity will still spawn -- they're
  technically different items)*
* "ERROR MESSAGE" Ahab (the one used by Master Gee).  Regular Ahabs will
  still spawn, though.
* Possibly one or two other guns as well -- I didn't think to keep track at
  first.

There's also a few drop pools / containers / etc which I've purposefully
left alone:

* White Chests
* Money Boxes
* Laundry Machines / Toilets / Cardboard Boxes
* Dumpsters
* Loot Midgets

Some other stuff not done:

* Scaylion drops are rather anemic compared to everything else in the
  Hammerlock DLC, but the Hammerlock DLC is kind of ludicrous with loot
  anyway, so I'm leaving them the way they are.
* Badass Giant Burning Broomsticks will continue to drop from the standard
  enemy pool rather than the badass pool.  There's dozens of those things
  all at once and it'd be ridiculous.
* In general I've not touched skin/head drop rates at all.  There's a few
  Hammerlock DLC creatures which have a rare skin drop which I ended up
  making guaranteed just because I was already in there looking for
  uniques/legendaries, but that's about it.
* From the Wedding Day Massacre Headhunter Pack: Ed, Stella, and Innuendobot
  don't actually drop anything -- I felt that was probably approprate and
  left them alone.

Other Recommended Mods
----------------------

There's a few things which I'd considered adding to this mod, but were already
well-covered in other mods, so instead I'll just mention them here.

* EmpireScum's "ButtStallion" will make Butt Stallion's drops in Flamerock Refuge
  much better (can choose between blue-or-higher, or all-gemstone).
* JimRaven's "#MakeVendorsGreatAgain2017" improves vendor stocks across the game.

TODO
----

* Playtesting in general (including with UCP)
* Balancing!  This mod is obviously very cheaty/OP, but I don't want it to
  be completely ludicrous.  I'd like it to still feel a bit special when
  Legendaries/Pearls/Seraphs get dropped, while at the same time providing
  a steady supply of fun gear.  Obviously this is very much down to personal
  preference.  Regardless, I've done extremely little actual playtesting
  with the current drop weights.
* Can we increase boss drop counts depending on player count?
* Untested components from Torgue DLC *(I'm afraid that's my least favorite
  DLC, to the point of not really liking it much, so I suspect that these
  may go untouched)*:
  * Pyro Pete's initial non-raid drops
  * Piston drops (just Slow Hand, I figure the mini-lootsplosion after is
    good enough to not bother tweaking his actual drop any more)
  * Torgue Biker Gang drops are a little weird - there's an extra drop which
    happens outside of their weighted drop pool, but I can't seem to figure
    out where that is.
  * I think Biker Badasses, etc, have pretty anemic drops at the moment.
  * In order to retain UCP compatibility, we had to alter how we guarantee
    Piston's Slow Hand drop.  This remains untested.
* Add in level names to our hotfixes which could technically use them
* I noticed that various enemies have a `CustomItemPoolList` defined in their
  `Playthroughs` section, for changes in TVHM/UVHM.  This seems to serve the
  purpose of, for instance, adding a shield which wouldn't be present in
  Normal.  We tweak enemies' ItemPools pretty often, and it would probably
  be good to run some tests to see if these `CustomItemPoolList` updates
  add to the pool list or if they replace it *(I suspect the latter)*.  If
  it does overwrite entirely, it's possible we'll need to add those structures
  into our patches.  For an example, see
  `GD_IncineratorMale.Balance.PawnBalance_IncineratorMale` from allium's
  `hunger_dynamic.upk`, which defines the Wattle Gobbler DLC's "Fuse, Tribute
  of Frostburn."  (Though I'm sure there are probably tons more examples just
  from the base game.)

Other Notes
-----------

It's perhaps worth mentioning that while this mod does a great job in most
of the game (IMO), in Normal mode at least, the amount of loot can get
pretty absurd when you're in any area which can generate a lot of Badasses
or the like.  The Hammerlock and Tiny Tina DLCs, in particular, were already
very generous with loot, and this mod steers them into ridiculousness.  The
last few stages of Murderlin's Magic Slaughter end up dropping enough loot
to cause some noticeble FPS hits on my system in fact:

Mod Construction / Implementation Details
-----------------------------------------

I actually generate this mod using a simple little Python script named
`generate-source.py`, which enables me to do things like set the rarity
drop levels from a single location at the top of the file, and have it
apply to a number of different objects throughout the game.  That script
outputs to a very human-readable multiline text file which can't actually
be read directly by FilterTool/Borderlands, and must then be processed by
my `conv_to_mod.py` script which you'll find in the parent directory.

To generate the end result file, I actually run the small shell script
`create.sh` in this directory, which just does the following:

    ./generate-source.py && \
        ../conv_to_mod.py -f "BL2 Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech - UCP Compat" && \
        ../conv_to_mod.py -f "BL2 Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech - Standalone"

Credits
-------

I've taken various ideas and snippets from a few other mods:

* Lifting early-game loot restrictions came directly from UCP, though I since
  expanded that section quite a bit.
* Setting guaranteed drops for the vast majority of bosses in-game, via
  two nicely-concise statements, came from JimRaven's "FarmFest"
* Orudeon's "Gemstone Loot Pools" clued me in that the main Gemstone pool in
  the Tiny Tina DLC is heavily weighted towards Pistols.
* FromDarkHell's "BL1Loot" provided a great index of gear for my own similar
  addition of uniques/pearls/seraphs into the legendary pool (though I went
  about it slightly differently)

I'd also like to thank the fine folks in Shadow's Evil Hideout #borderlands-modding
Discord channel for putting up with all my noobish questions.
