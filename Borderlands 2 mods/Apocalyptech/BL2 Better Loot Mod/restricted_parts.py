# Takes the "Resource - InventoryPartListCollectionDefinition.txt" file from
# FilterTool's internal resources dir, and generates a list of `set` commands
# to remove gamestage/level requirements from all parts for everything found
# in the file which isn't already set to level 0 or 1.  This is overkill, and
# includes some properties we don't even actually need, but whatever.

# I apologize for how awful the code is - this is super hacky.

# Maliwan Aquamarine snipers are a bit weird - there's some kind of
# hotfix-like behavior which happens after the main menu which redefines
# the loot pool, and the PartListCollection number suffix ends up
# changing when that happens.  Linux/Mac users have to exit to the
# "press any key" menu before executing patches, and at that point this
# hotfix-like fix has already been done, but Windows users do not.  Anyway,
# the upshot is that Windows users will require that one class to be
# hotfixed rather than just `set`, since they won't have the new number
# yet.
