Fragile Minecraft Blocks
========================

Causes the Minecraft blocks (in the little secret area of Caustic Caverns) to
be extremely fragile.  Damage of nearly any sort will destroy them immediately
now: a single melee strike will do, but also most guns, etc.  Area-effect damage,
such as from a Splasher Blaster, or some grenade types, will still *not* destroy
these blocks, though.

Happy mining!

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.1**, November 6, 2018:
 * Updated README and description, to reflect that area-effect damage
   still won't affect these blocks.  I don't think there's anything I
   can do about that, alas.

**v1.0.0**, November 4, 2018:
 * Initial public release
