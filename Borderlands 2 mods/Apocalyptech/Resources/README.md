default_values.txt
------------------

This file contains partial output from a whole bunch of `obj dump <foo>`
commands from the Borderlands 2 console, used while constructing mods so
that I could see what the default B2 values were.  This is from a system
running with all DLC enabled.  The data in here is obviously pretty
scattershot, since it only includes the specific things that I was looking
for, but here it is, regardless.  Also, I generally don't put the *entire*
`obj dump` output in there -- just the bits that I was directly interested
in.

default_values_processed.txt
----------------------------

This is just `default_values.txt` but run through my `conv_to_human.py`
script, which you can find in the parent directory.  This is the one that's
actually pretty human-readable, and it's what I look at while looking into
things.
