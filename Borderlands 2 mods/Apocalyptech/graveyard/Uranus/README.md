Uranus (abandoned mod)
======================

I had a thought that it'd be amusing to mod Saturn so that it was really
tiny, completely ineffectual in combat, and named Uranus instead.  (I
actually thought of Neptune at first, but I think Uranus fits the highbrow
Borderlands humor a bit better.  Pluto is also an obvious choice but I feel
that poor ol' Pluto doesn't deserve to be saddled with a joke mod like
this.)

Anyway, this turned out to be more difficult than I'd anticipated, because
I couldn't get the visual scaling to work out.  Once you scale down
Saturn's body a little ways, the arms separate from the body, and I
couldn't figure out a way to get them to reattach (interestingly, the laser
beam charging, and the beams themselves, come out of the "correct" spot,
where the arms would be if they were attached properly).  Once you scale
the body down past about 25%, the arms disappear altogether.  The turret
mounts, similarly, get rather messed up.

So anyway, the work is not worth the not-especially-hilarious joke, so I'm
abandoning it.  Someone who's more adept at fiddling with character models
in Borderlands might find it more straightforward than I - have at it, if
so!  As with all my mods, I'm releasing 'em into public domain.  No need
to even credit me if you do run with this and get it to work.

What's Done
-----------

* Scales the character down to 40%; was keeping it bigger to be able to see
  the parts more clearly while figuring out spacing, etc.
* Weak as a wet tissue, should be one-shottable with even a level 1 weapon.
  Often kills itself with its own missile barrage, in fact.
* Renamed

What's Not
----------

* Size (IMO needs to be at least 20% or so to be Properly Amusing)
* Beam-weapon damage (and size?) - from arms
* Turret damage - from turrets
* Missile damage and size
* Homing drone damage and size
* stomp effectiveness
* occupying-space radius
* gib size
* Voice (pitch everything up higher)
* Maybe make it speedier?
