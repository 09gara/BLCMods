This is a list of my weaponry, that i personally consider to be my best work

1. The Nukem Mortar MKII
I personally think that this is my best and most creative creation.

2. The Golden Flamethrower
The second player flamethrower out there, the third weapon i've ever made, but still makes it to the best weaponry list.
