This is a list of my weaponry, that i personally consider to be my best work

1. The Nukem Mortar MKII
I personally think that this is my best and most creative creation.

2. The Golden Flamethrower
The second player flamethrower out there, the third weapon i've ever made, but still makes it to the best weaponry list.

3. The Reloader
A very new weapon, with a broken barrel that cannot fire, but can still do massive damage.

4. G30 Sweeper
The gun from the hardcore guns series, but it might be the only gun that will be in the seires
