Future Plans: I Plan on eventually making my way through all of the seasonal and solar courts in Sarah J. Maas's books, but there are logistical issues (Ex. For Winter Court cryo of course but that is only in TPS, Water as an element is not really a thing so bye bye Summer Court, etc etc). The theoretically improbably ones will probably just end up as beautiful skins and renames.

Autumn Court will be fire only (maybe)/fire based shotgun, probably replace the Blockhead but elementally unlock it.
Dawn Court will have literally all the healing on the planet for single player and allies. Damage reduction as well.
Day Court is meant to be a shield/spell cleaver, no ideas here yet really. Maybe extra damage against shields if it is possible. 


Other Plans:
  - TF2 weapons ported into Bl2, this is already happening however with things like Sasha.
  - Melee Zer0 is nice, so probably a Rapier with 100% slag chance, increased weapon swap speed, healing, more melee damage bonus,      reduced status effect duration, etc, just the perfect weapon all around for melee so constant swapping to the Grog is not           needed.
  - Increase shield recharge delays on all Roid Shields to 10-15 seconds.
