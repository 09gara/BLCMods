-BL2-Loot-Despawner (Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell made this and asked me to upload it)

It's a very simple mod that causes loot of ALL rarities to despawn after ~1 minute from their spawn. This applies to all chests and drops, so make sure to look at the loot before it shrinks and despawns!
In theory this should help in regards to FPS, inventory, and other issues caused by someone or something dropping a lot of loot.
This seems to work perfectly fine with all quest items (no despawning quest items) that require them to be picked up. So it should be safe in any playthrough with quests remaining. 
It makes using a mod such as LootSploder more friendly to PC's and will help prevent crashes from region transitions caused by too many items being saved on the ground. 
Feel free to edit the part of text after "DropLifeSpanType=" to customize the duration to your liking.

Examples of different despawn times:

DROP_VeryShortLived   -   ~1 minute shrink and despawn time from item spawn (not from time of impact).

DROP_ShortLived  -  Shrink and despawn time at ~10 minutes from item spawn.

DROP_LongLived  -  Shrink and despawn time at ~30 minutes from item spawn.

DROP_LiveAsLongAsLevel  -  Stays on the ground or in chests for as long as you stay in the loaded map area. If you travel out and back in, these items will be deleted.

DROP_LiveForever   -  Stays on the ground and in chests forever, even when changing maps by travelling (does not save dropped loot when you save and quit and re-load the save)

Also, this mod allows you to make custom colored stuff for each rarity. So you can alter the Red, Green, Blue numbers for different colored beams and item cards. Setting all of the above to 0 will result in a very black, nearly unreadable black text and beam color. Setting them all to 255 will make a blinding and likely unreadable white text and beam color.
