
Challenge Revamp - BL2 - ChallengeRevamp.txt

Restructures the challenge system, as well as difficulty changes to some. Changes the prestige requirement to 45%

Changes most lvl 2 & 3 challenges and their rewards to reflect lvl 3 & 5 respectively as well as an additional 75 badass points for lvl 3. 

Lvl 4 & 5 challenges are now completely different. Lvl 4 is ~5x harder than lvl 3, but rewards 500 badass points except for few challenges (e.g. Deal certain amounts of elemental DOT). Lvl 5 is basically a record tracker, rewards 1,000 badass points.

The "Yo dawg, I heard you like challenges" challenge will now be completed with level challenges instead of lvl 5 challenges since they are extremely difficult to complete.



Apply Badass Rank Bonus Stats to Deathtrap and Sabre Turret - BL2 - BadassStatsToDTandSabre.txt & BadassStatsToDTandSabreOffline.txt- HOTFIX

Applies the following bonus stats you currently have from badass ranking to these two whereas it wouldn't:

Max Health - Deathtrap
Shield Capacity, Recharge Rate & Delay - Deathtrap
Melee Damage - Deathtrap
Grenade Damage - Both
Gun Damage - Both
Fire Rate - Sabre Turret
Reload Speed - Sabre Turret
Recoil Reduction - Sabre Turret
Accuracy - Sabre Turret
Elemental DOT - Both

Unfortunately, the Health and Shield bonus stats cannot be applied to the Sabre Turret as they weren't working properly as I intended (As a compensation, buffs will be 25% stronger).



Level Challenge Reward multiplier - BL2 - 5xLevelChals.txt OR 10xLevelChals.txt

Multiplies the badass points you get from area challenges by either 5, or 10. Includes reward changes for Pirate and Torgue DLC.
