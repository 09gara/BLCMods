Restructures the challenge system, as well as difficulty changes to some. Changes the prestige requirement to 45%

Changes most lvl 2 & 3 challenges and their rewards to reflect lvl 3 & 5 respectively as well as an additional 75 badass points for lvl 3. 

Lvl 4 & 5 challenges are now completely different. Lvl 4 is ~5x harder than lvl 3, but rewards 500 badass points except for few challenges (e.g. Deal certain amounts of elemental DOT). Lvl 5 is basically a record tracker, rewards 1,000 badass points.

<<<<<< master
The "Yo dawg, I heard you like challenges" challenge will now be completed with level challenges instead of lvl 5 challenges since they are extremely difficult to complete for most.

Apply Badass Rank Bonus Stats to Deathtrap and Sabre Turret - BL2 - BadassStatsToDTandSabre.txt & BadassStatsToDTandSabreOffline.txt - HOTFIX

Applies the following bonus stats you currently have from badass ranking to these two whereas it wouldn't:

Max Health - Deathtrap
Shield Capacity, Recharge Rate & Delay - Deathtrap
Melee Damage - Deathtrap
Grenade Damage - Both
Gun Damage - Both
Fire Rate - Sabre Turret
Reload Speed - Sabre Turret
Recoil Reduction - Sabre Turret
Accuracy - Sabre Turret
Elemental DOT - Both

Unfortunately, the Health and Shield bonus stats cannot be applied to the Sabre Turret as they weren't working properly as I intended (As a compensation, buffs will be 25% stronger).





Level Challenge Reward multiplier - BL2 - 5xLevelChals.txt OR 10xLevelChals.txt

Multiplies the badass points you get from area challenges by either 5, or 10. Includes reward changes for Pirate and Torgue DLC.





Better Vehicles (SLAG IMMUNITY! NO, I'M NOT JOKING) - BL2 - BetterVehicles.txt - HOTFIX

Contains 3 sections that can be individually disabled by using the FilterTool. All are enabled by default.

Basically gives the following buffs to every vehicles in the game (except for AI-controlled ones):


100% Immunity to Slag damage for all vehicles. E.g. Slag Impact shots and status effect.

YES, YOU'RE NOT MISREADING IT. TOTAL IMMUNITY TO SLAG. NO MORE F**KING PERMASLAG EVER. NOW YOU CAN ROAM AROUND ARID NEXUS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING PERMASLAGGED.

ALSO, 20% DAMAGE REDUCTION TO EVERYTHING (40% for Flamethrower Fanboat) AND A 25% HP BONUS. 

ALSO WATCH THIS VIDEO ABOUT PERMASLAGS. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILXatR9jbUA


Increased Ramming damage to suit UVHM better. Technicals and Fan Boats get better bonuses. Sandskiffs are excluded.


Made some adjustments to vehicle weaponry (Basically damage bonuses to suit UVHM better).

OUTRUNNER
+Increased Machine Gun fire rate (the top one, not in the front)
+Replaced Rocket Launcher and alt fire damage type from Rocket to Grenade
+Increased Rocket Launcher fire rate, damage, and projectile speed
+Increased Rocket Launcher alt fire (Homing Rockets) damage, and projectile speed

BANDIT TECHNICAL
+Increased Sawblade damage and fire rate
+Increased Barrel Damage (Not sure why I did this)

SANDSKIFFS (No way to decrease ram self damage)
+Increased Machine Gun fire rate, and damage
+Replaced Rocket, and Harpoon damage type from Rocket to Grenade
+Increased Rocket damage, fire rate, and projectile speed
+Increased Harpoon damage, and fire rate
+Technical Sawblade buffs apply the same

FAN BOATS
+Increased Machine Gun damage, and accuracy
+Increased Corrosive spew fire rate, and damage
+Increased Shock Ball damage
-No Flamethrower buffs due to how it is structured. It's the reason why I gave the Flamethrower Fan Boat better damage reduction from everything.
