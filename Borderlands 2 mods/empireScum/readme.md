#1: The Scimitar
>The scimitar replaces the rapier. The scimitar deals +100% melee damage and has a magazine size of 0. When equipped, it heals the wielder at the rate of 30% of all damage done. The gun has been hexed with the curse of the porcelain fist. The grog nozzle is a contraversial weapon due to it's healing power. However, melee characters (Kreig and Zer0) rely upon it to health gate. This weapon is meant to alleviate some of the problems introduced by the Grog Nozzle, while allowing heroes that depend upon it to continue with their schtick.

Special thanks to zububu for the *sweet* idea.

#2: Singularity Unf0reseen
>Adds a singularity effect to Unf0reseen that scales with the number of invested skill points 

Special thanks to Mike for letting me *borrow* and modify his Slag Unf0reseen code and to the_Nocturni for helping me with scaling the singularity radius.

#3: Legendary Vendors
>This mod replaces all loot in the vendor at Uncle Teddy's with legendary loot
