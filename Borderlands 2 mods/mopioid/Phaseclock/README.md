Phaseclock
===================

Phaseclock provides key bindings to adjust the game speed on the fly.

The `[` key halves the game speed up to five times in succession (1/32 speed), while `]` doubles it up to five times (32x speed).

6. You are now ready to use Phaseclock (see Usage section below)

Usage
------------

Phaseclock must be executed *in game* before you may use its keybindings.

This may be done simply by running `exec Patch.txt` (or `exec [name of your BLCMM file]`), or simply `exec Phaseclock/Phaseclock.blcm`, after you have loaded in to the game.

Each time you save and quit, the next time you load in, Phaseclock must be executed again.

(For easier execution of mods on the fly, use [c0dycode's Autoexec](https://github.com/c0dycode/BL-AutoexecDLL))

Once executed, each time the `[` key is tapped, it will halve the game speed (up to 1/32 speed). Each time the `]` key is tapped, it will double the game speed (up to 32x speed).
