BL2 Reborn BETA 1.3.1 Known Issues

- For some reason, BL2 Reborn completely deletes the Boom Puppy from the game. Don't ask me how.

- Random crashes (probably related to either Loot Pools or the problem above). Report crashes to me (what you did, don't send me crash logs, I'm not a Gearbox wizard).
