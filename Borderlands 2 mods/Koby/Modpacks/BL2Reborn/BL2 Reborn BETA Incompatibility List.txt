BL2 Reborn BETA 1.3.2 Incompatibility List

The following mods are incompatible with BL2 Reborn and I won't fix them to be compatible with Reborn either. If the mod authors want to create a compatible version for Reborn I'll gladly re-review this list.

NOTE: There's no such thing as "hard incompatibility" in Borderlands 2. You will however encounter unintended behavior and instability / crashes if you use mods together which simply aren't intended to go together.

INCOMPATIBLE:


Borderlands UCP: Already included in Reborn.

Vanilla Enhanced: Already included in Reborn.

Please read what even is included in BL2 Reborn.


Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech: Will cause unintended behavior and frequent crashes.

Every Loot by FromDarkHell: Will cause unintended behavior and frequent crashes.

Cold Dead Hands by Apocalyptech: Not tested but will probably cause unintended behavior and frequent crashes.

Actually, probably every Loot related mod ever.


FFYLands 2 by Hemaxhu: Why would you do this.

Again, probably every modpack ever.
