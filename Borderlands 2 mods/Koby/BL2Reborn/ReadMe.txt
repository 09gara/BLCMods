If you want to experience Borderlands 2 in a new way, this modpack is exactly for you.

As of version 2.0.2, there are 150+ mods in BL2Reborn. You can find a list of all mods and their descriptions in the attached "Mod List.txt".

Download the modpack by rightclicking the "Download" button in "BL2Reborn.txt" and "Save link as...".

You can enable optional mods at the bottom of the modpack with the Filter Tool.

Lots of options are hand-picked by me. Don't enable/disable stuff unless you know exactly what you're doing!

I also !!!HIGHLY!!! recommend using the Hex Multitool to disable Sanity Checks
