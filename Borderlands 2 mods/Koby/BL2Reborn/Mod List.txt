Unofficial Community Patch 4.0.14 (By Shadowevil and the community)
For closer details, please check the attached UCP Full Changelog.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Badassify (By theNocturni)
Increases Badass enemy spawnrate by 100%/500% in TVHM/UVHM, depending which module you activate. (100% by default)


Enemy Enhancer (By theNocturni)
Gives enemy better guns as your OP level goes up. 
Enemies may spawn with blue/purple/etech/even red text(unique/seraph/legendary/pearlescent) guns, and you will rarely see enemies using white or green gear on OP8. 
Some enemies may spawn with blue/purple/Legendary/some red text shields. 
Makes some enemies roll faster and stagger for a shorter duration. 
Doubles Turret/Deathtrap health and makes it unslaggable.


Eridium Chest (By Hemaxhu)
Allows you to open the Golden Chest in Sanctuary with Eridium.


Slag Overhaul (By B33PB00PJOE)
This overhauls the slag element completely, based on the amazing Cryo Mod by Aaron0000, Kazy, Mike, FromDarkHell, and The Campin' Dutchman.
Turns Slag into something less polarizing, a bit of a hybrid of Slag and Cryo!
Changes from Vanilla Slag:
+75% movement slowdown when slagged.
Reduces fire rate by 37.5% when slagged.
+125% melee / critical damage.
+75% non-slag bonus damage.
+50% slag on slag damage.
Added Damage over time.
8 second base duration, like Death Mark
Slag is naturally weak vs shields, dealing less damage / DoT and having a lesser application chance.


TPS Scaling (By adudney)
Makes the game scale by 10% per level instead of 13% per level, similar to Borderlands TPS.


UVHM+ (By theNocturni)
Gives enemy double shield recharge rate(not delay/capacity, just rate). 
Improves world drop lootpool so that youd have a better chance for blue/purple/legendary, and less whites. 
(Hopefully) increases enemy accuracy. 
Increases badass health and shields by about 50%. Reduces DoT buff to +150% instead of +250% and increases Maliwan SMG/Pistol DoT to compensate. 
Reduces enemy gun damage and DoT damage a bit to compensate for much better guns and more frequent DoTs.


Vendors Enhanced (By Koby)
Combines parts of MakeVendorsGreatAgain and Vendors+ to make a new, optimized vendor mod.
