FAQ 

"How do I install mods?"
  1. Download LightChaosman's Filter Tool (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ4qI4U_lE0) and install Java if you don't have it yet.
  2. Start the Filter Tool and select "Hex edit Borderlands2.exe" and "Enable console" with Tilde or F6 (you can skip this if you did it arleady)
  3. Place the mod file into your Borderlands 2 Binaries folder (somewhere around \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2\Binaries)
  4. Start Borderlands and go into the main menu, hit the console key and enter "exec MODNAME.txt" without the quote symbols (if the mod isn't a .txt, you can leave the file extension away)
  5. If the console or chat display nothing after executing the mod, everything worked!

"The Filter Tool doesn't work!"
  Install the correct version of Java (https://www.java.com/en/download/win10.jsp) or try this method by LightChaosman:

  If your filtertool is not starting, but you are being able to execute as a .jar file, try running it using your command line interface.
  To run it with CMD you usually use "java -jar FilterTool.jar".
  Instead, try running it with "java -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=50 -jar FilterTool.jar"
  It should look like this: http://i.imgur.com/1KlYie9.png
  To open a CMD in your binaries folder, hold shift while right clicking (no file selected), which in your binaries folder will look something like this: http://i.imgur.com/UutSgKq.png
  Alternatively you can type cmd in your adress bar and press enter.

"I'm getting two error lines which say something with Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6!"
  This happens if the mod contains hotfixes. Wait a few seconds in the main menu before executing the mod. 
  You also have to be online and connected to Steam for hotfixes to work. They won't work on a cracked Borderlands 2 version.

"What is a hotfix?"
  A hotfix is basically a change which only works if you're online. Only one mod with a hotfix can be running at the same time. If you want to run mutliple hotfixes, check the next question.

"How can I merge mods/hotfixes?"
  1. Open the Filter Tool.
  2. In the navigation bar, select "File" and "Open file" and pick the mod.
  3. Once the mod is opened in the Filter Tool, click on "Developer Tools" and choose "Add single mod".
  4. Pick the mod you want to add and done.
 (5. If you want to change the load order, click "Developer Tools" and choose "Enable structural edits", then drag the mod where you want it to be. Mods lower in the load order will overwrite mods higher in the load order.)

"Do mods work in Co-Op?"
  Yes and no. The host has to enable the mods, but it's highly recommended to share and have the same mods enabled for stability reasons, not all mods will work if only the host has them enabled.
  If you're off-host and you enable mods the host doesn't have, they won't work and cause issues.
  If the host has a mod, and the other players don't, no visual changes will take place.
