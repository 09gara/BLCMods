Hello.

I've just wanted to share this little patch that makes Pangolin Battery on shields appear visually different from
Maliwan Battery. I've done it by just making the Pangolin Battery model appear as empty model.
This makes it easier to differentiate perfect shields (The Bee in particular) from those that are non-perfect for those
who like to farm gear rather than gib it and don't know all the numbers for recharge rate and so on.

Example can be seen here:
