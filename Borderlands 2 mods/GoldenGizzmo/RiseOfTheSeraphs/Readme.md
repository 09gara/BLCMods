# Rise Of The Seraphs
# Created by GoldenGizzmo

# This mod is a seraph overhaul that aims to bring a fresh experience to the late game, replacing gear I thought were uncreative or underwhelming, with my own gear and even featuring some special guests too.

# NOTE: This mod uses hotfixes, you must add this as a mod in filter tool for the drops to work.

# Includes:
# - 9 New Weapons (Including Aaron0000's Destroyer, Battle Bee's Pulverizer and B33PB00PJOE's Florentine)
# - 2 New Grenades
# - 2 New Shields
# - Reshuffles all seraph lootpools to fit suit the new gear, vendors and bosses now have different drops
# - Raid bosses drops a lot more crystals on death now, so vendor seraphs are now little bonuses, not gear to grind an hour for
