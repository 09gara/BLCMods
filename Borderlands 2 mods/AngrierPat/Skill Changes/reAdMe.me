 Hello again! Pat here to tell you about the skill changes I've made.
 
 
 # SmallerLighterFaster

    Increased the Reload bonus from 6% to 10%.
    Lowers the Shock and Augh reload bonus from 25% to 10%
    Logic: Axtons Ready is 8% per point at T1 with no downside, this makes it competitive with that.
    Logic: 25% on a Game Changer was a bit much, so I spread out the bonuses some more.
