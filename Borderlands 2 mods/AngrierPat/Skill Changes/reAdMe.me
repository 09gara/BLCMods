 Hello again! Pat here to tell you about the skill changes I've made.
 
 
 # [SmallerLighterFaster](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/RZz_qZDADQuxWDdtglYPCUNiEQhFSutf3wfWKQnXp1g/https/cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/288382606288879629/331273726496604170/unknown.png)

    Increased the Reload bonus from 6% to 10%.
    Lowers the Shock and Augh reload bonus from 25% to 10%.
    Logic: Axtons Ready is 8% per point at T1 with no downside, this makes it competitive with that.
    Logic: 25% on a Game Changer was a bit much, so I spread out the bonuses some more.
    

 # [Anarchy Rework](https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/294502426302742529/331858795666079755/unknown.png?width=443&height=561)

    Halved stacks, doubled bonuses and downsides.
    Lowers Rational anarchist to 15 stacks instead of 25 to compensate.
    Max unboosted stacks lowered to 200 from 400.
    With claws bonuses where also doubled per stack.
        

 # [Death From Above Buff](https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/294502426302742529/332321147972485121/unknown.png)

    Significantly improved the damage.
    Increased the radius from 500 to 750.
    Added a Stagger effect.
    Changed the damage type from Explosive to Shock.
    Increased the Cooldown from 2s to 5s.
    

 # [Slag Make It Sparkle](https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/294502426302742529/332031364578934785/unknown.png)

    Made all varrients of Make It Sparkle give DT additional Slag damage.
    This was done so that one doesnt have to swap back to slag DT mid fight.
    However, DT will still look like whichever element he was last shot with.
    For style of course.
    
 # [Potent as a Pony Change](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/297567136363315201/332925211429175296/unknown.png)

    Swaped Gaige and DTs health stat bonuses. 

 # [Myelin Buff](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/297567136363315201/332925344921157643/unknown.png)

    Increased shock resistance.
    Logic:With More Pep buffed in the patch Myelin didnt have a place.
        

 # Interspersed Outburst Buff

    Upped the slag chance by 2x.
    Slags often at 5/5.
    

 # [Cooking Up Trouble Change](https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/306488182998827018/332922258312003584/unknown.png)

    Now regen health as long as your mag is half full.
    Lowered health regen from .4% to .3% per point.
