#<The Most Accurate Mod In Existence>

    #<Description>

        Made by Glory.

        The idea for this mod simply sprung up when talking

        about something that would lead me to mention the Norfleet.

        I felt this name was appropriate because The Norfleet is both very Accurate

        (So much so that Anarchy has no affect on it's ability to hit)

        and literally everyone uses it essentially as a Get Out Of FFYL Free Card.

        Hence its name in this mod.

        THIS MOD IS PURELY AESTHETIC. THIS WEAPON WILL NOT FUNCTION ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM THIS MOD.

        set GD_Weap_Launchers.Name.Title_Maliwan.Title_Barrel_Maliwan_Norfleet:AttributePresentationDefinition_8 NoConstraintText None shall kill you... Other than the gun itself.
