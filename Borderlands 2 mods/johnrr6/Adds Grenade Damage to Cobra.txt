##### Adds Grende Damage Bonus to Cobra ##### (Thanks to the_Nocturni for assistance)
# While Shadow's upgrades to the Cobra in the UCP have made it a MUCH more valuable piece.....it still does not become viable enough for most charecters.  But with this boost added to an Axton of Krieg, the Cobra will become one of the BEST snipers in the game. Copy and paste this at the beginning of Shadow's UCP

####### WARNING! ######## DO NOT use this code if you are going to use the Cobra with a Maya Charecter as the addition of Grenade Damage REMOVES the benefit of Reaper Splash damage on Maya with a Cobra.
