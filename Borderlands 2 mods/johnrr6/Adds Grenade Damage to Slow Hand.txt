##### Adds Grenade Damage Bonus to the Slow Hand ##### (Thanks to the_Nocturni for assistance)
# This boost makes the Slow Hand slightly OP in testing  This is a WIP.....Base Damage should probably be reduced a bit....more work needs to be done on this to make it totally balanced and more viable at OP8.
# Copy and paste at the Beggining of the UCP

####### WARNING! ######## DO NOT use this code if you are going to use the Slow Hand with a Maya Character as the addition of Grenade Damage REMOVES the benefit of Reaper Splash damage on Maya with Slow Hand.
