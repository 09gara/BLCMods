####### Moxxi's Slipless Crit ####### (Courtesy of Kazy)
This mod is completely Kazy's work, I am simply reposting it here because it is such a nice little addition to the game.  The Crit is close to worthless as is....her mod changes it to a viable shock SMG...that heals!

# The Crit will no longer fly out of your hands.  Copy and paste this into the beginning of the UCP.
