#This is Greeem.
#My folder on this GitHub is mostly for OP weapons I like to mess around with in my free time that I made. You do not need to use these #weapons, you can modify them in any way you want. I do not care.
#All I ask is that you do not redistribute my material as your own. Even if it's modified. If you use my mods for a guide and you #completely change EVERYTHING, that's a different story. Do not hate on me because I make these. I only make these to fuck around in my #free time as I have gone through this game so many times on every platform it's ever been released on.
#Thank you for your time.

Thank you,
   Greeem
