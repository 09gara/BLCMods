I haven't quit modding, I'm just a bit inactive because I moved back to Germany and have to catch up a lot with school.
Also, if you have an idea for a mod or want to play Dirty Bomb with me, add me on Steam: [link](http://steamcommunity.com/id/HolyHades)

Two mods of mine have been reviewed by 00TheMessiah00, check them out.
