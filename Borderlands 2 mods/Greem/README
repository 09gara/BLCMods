  This is Greeem.
  My folder on this GitHub is mostly for OP weapons I like to mess around with in my free time that I made. You do not need to use these weapons, you can modify them in any way you want. I do not care.
  All I ask is that you do not redistribute my material as your own. Even if it's modified. If you use my mods for a guide and you completely change EVERYTHING, that's a different story. Do not hate on me because I make these. I only make these to fuck around in my free time as I have gone through this game so many times on every platform it's ever been released on.
  Thank you for your time.
  
  All of my skins are made by Soze unless otherwise stated in the txt file.
  I did not make ANY of the files in the Resources folder. I just uploaded them ALL under one folder for convenience.
  
  
  Sincerely,
    Greeem
