I use this to fuck around on borderlands, basically it boosts important stats like melee damage and firerate to be a stupidly high amount. Use at your own risk, your guns will run out of ammo fast!





#How to install

Where your borderlands saves are located, there's a file named profile.bin. Take that file and drag it somewhere else for a backup. Drag the profile.bin you downloaded from me into your old one's place, then load up the game. If all goes right, you should have OP badass rank!

Enjoy!
