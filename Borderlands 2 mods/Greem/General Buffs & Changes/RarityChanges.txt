		This mod literally just makes some guns' rarities be more fitting. For example, a Harold is now Pearl.
		This does not make changes to pearls drop from loot midgets (Although they still might rarely)
		
		I hope you guys enjoy :D
		There will be more to come here, I just need to find what to change and how to change it.
