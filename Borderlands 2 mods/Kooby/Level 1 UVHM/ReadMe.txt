------LEVEL 1 UVHM------

By Koby

This mod allows you to play in UVHM from level 1 with all UVHM modifiers active and all level restrictions lifted.

WARNING: THIS IS VERY HARD AND YOU WILL SUFFER IN THE EARLY LEVELS AND PROBABLY FURTHER INTO THE GAME. MODS LIKE VENDORS+ BY THENOCTURNI ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. MODS LIKE UVHM+ AND ENEMYENHANCER MAKE THIS EXTREMELY HARD.

Credit to Shadowevil for providing the hexcode and the UVHM modifier code and Nifsara for the save files.

------INSTALLATION------

To make this work you need to do three things:

1. Hexedit 430083FE32 into 430083FE01 in your Borderlands2.exe (Tutorial soon™)

2. Place a pre-set save file into your Borderlands 2 save directory (usually at \Documents\My Games\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\SaveData\<########...>)

3. Download and run the Level1UVHM.txt mod like any other mod (contains hotfixes so mod merging is needed if you run multiple hotfixed mods)

The included save files are needed because they have UVHM unlocked. 

You can also grab the two weapon SDUs from the bank because you won't get them from the quest.

Pro tip: You can find a bank at Claptrap's Place.
