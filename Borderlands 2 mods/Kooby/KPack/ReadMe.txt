!!!WARNING!!!
Some mods in this modpack violate sanity checks. 
This means loading into the game without the modpack enabled will remove existing items which violate sanity checks like weapons which have an accessory + melee attachment.
Use c0dycode's multitool to disable sanity checks ( https://github.com/c0dycode/BL2ModStuff/blob/master/Hexediting/BL2%20Hex-Multitool%20Dark%20Mode.zip ) or make sure to always load the modpack first before entering the game.

Modpack Contents (for extended descriptions, open the modpack with the Filter Tool and look at the mods yourself):

-----Unofficial Communtiy Patch 3.1 (By Shadow and the Community)-----

  Check the attached "BL2 Community Patch Full Changelog v3.1" file

-----Main Modules (Need to load first)----- (They need to load first cause other mods will overwrite changes in these modules)

  Gear Overhaul (By Orudeon, AngrierPat, theNocturni, Zububu, LightChaosman, Mike, FromDarkHell et al.)
  Huge Overhaul to basically all items in the game, check with the FilterTool to see what it does or go here https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon

  Gemstone Fixes (By Aaron0000)
  Makes it so that any mod that modifies the Quartz gemstone visuals no longer affects the Emerald, Citrine, and Garnet weapons as well. 

  Old Hyperion (Pre-Sequelstyle) (By Aaron0000)
  Changes Hyperion to how they are in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, including names, stats and skins. (Only rare skins and stats are enabled in the KPack by default)

  Double Anarchy (By Aaron0000)
  Changes the accuracy accessory of SMGs into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1. Changes Bandit barrels to be similar to the Anarchy barrels from Borderlands 1. Together they form Double Anarchies.

  E-Tech Pistols Remastered (By Aaron0000)
  Overhauls the Darts into a more useful form, and replaces Spikers with a new type of weapon (Plasma Pistol).

  Revolvers (By Aaron0000)
  Changes the Jakobs pistol barrel to behave like the Revolvers of Borderlands 1. 

  Mashers (By Aaron0000)
  Changes the double accessory of all pistols into the Masher accessory from Borderlands 1.

  Quadtastic (By Aaron0000)
  Turns every non-E-Tech barreled unique/legendary/seraph Shotgun in the game into quad-barreled versions. (Only a few are enabled in the KPack by default for balance reasons.)

  Splitters (By Aaron0000)
  Re-imagines Splat Guns into Splitters from Pre-Sequel.

  Tough ARs (By Aaron0000)
  Replaces the foregrip accessory of Assault Rifles. Changes it to boost damage resistance (35%) instead of recoil reduction.

  Vertical Grip Fix (By Aaron0000)
  Adjusts the Vertical Grip so that it gives 40% more projectiles (30% in the KPack) instead of a flat +2 projectiles. Shotguns with low projectile count have separate changes.

-----Optional Modules----- (These have to be enabled with the Filter Tool if you want to use them.)

  FFYLaim (By theNocturni)
  Allows ADS while in FFYL. Doesn't work sometimes for whatever reason, especially off-host.

  No Damage Numbers (By LightChaosman)
  Removes the floating damage numbers.

  No Spawn Limits (By LightChaosman)
  This mod removes the spawnlimit from the game. Where normally only between 10-20 enemies could be on the map at any given time, this number is now unlimited. This might cause a slight drop in performance.

  Rarity Matching Item Glows (By Aaron0000)
  Gives the glowy bits on weapons/grenades a change of color to match their rarity. Also disables the glow for elemental variants.

  TPS Scaling (By adudney)
  Makes the game scale like Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (10% per level instead of 13% per level). As a side effect, it also makes OP levels easier.

  TPSkills (By FromDarkHell and Zububu)
  Changes the layout of Axton's, Maya's, Zer0's and Salvador's skill tree to look similar to the layout of the skill trees in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Also allows you to progress from Tier 3 to Tier 4 with only one point instead of five.

  TPS Skills (By adudney) (Not to be confused with TPSkills)
  Technically does the same thing as TPSkills but without the skilltree layout changes. Also has support for Gaige and Maya.

-----Aaron0000-----

  Seraph Skins DLC 1 Style
  Changes the visuals of the Hawk Eye, Infection, Interfacer, Lead Storm, and Devastator to be in line with the rest of the Seraph weapons.

  Infection UCP 4 Skin
  The Infection is getting a revamped skin in the next version of the Unofficial Community Patch, but since people want it, I figure a separate download until it comes out is fine.

  Hawkeye UCP

  Changes the Lucrative Opportunity relic to regenerate ammo (excluding rocket launchers and grenades).
