Makes all Dahl snipers semi auto (with the exception of the Pitchfork) because something made for precision should never have had burst fire in the first place.
The Pitchfork now always has a 4 round burst because that was never a precision weapon to begin with and so its still useful against bosses.

Big thanks to the_Noctunri and Exotek for helping me troubleshoot this to make it work :D
